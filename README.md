To use the interactive book recommender:
1. Download books_with_emotions.csv
2. Download the jpeg (cover-image_not-found)
3. Run gradio-dash.py


The other files are to show the process that lead to the final csv and dashbord, from loading data, processing it,
getting the document embeddings, and doing the zero-shot classification
